# Tourist Agencies website

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Website usage

To view all functionality of the website, login as an admin with `admin` as the username and password.

To use the website as a regular user, login with `marko` as the username and `marko123` as the password.

Because the project specification says so, an admin & regular user have access to every function of the website.
This is subject to change.
